## ðŸš€ CodeSprint 2.0 â€” 45 Days of DSA Practice

Welcome to my **CodeSprint 2.0** repository!
This repo contains my daily coding practice, solutions, and notes as part of the 45-day **CodeSprint 2.0** challenge hosted by **USC.KIIT**.


### ðŸ“Œ **About the Challenge**

**CodeSprint 2.0** is a structured coding marathon designed to help participants strengthen their Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) skills through consistent daily practice.
This journey helps build:

* Strong problem-solving abilities
* Clean, optimized coding habits
* A disciplined routine to tackle DSA systematically


### ðŸ§© **Topics Covered**

Some of the key DSA topics Iâ€™m covering during this sprint:

* Arrays & Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stacks & Queues
* Trees & Binary Search Trees
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Sorting & Searching Algorithms
* Dynamic Programming
* Graph Algorithms
* And more!


### âš¡ **How to Use**

* Browse daily folders to see my solutions and notes.
* Feel free to fork this repo or clone it for reference.
* Suggestions and improvements are always welcome!


### ðŸ“ˆ **My Goal**

To develop a rock-solid foundation in DSA, build problem-solving discipline, and prepare myself for technical interviews and real-world coding challenges.
